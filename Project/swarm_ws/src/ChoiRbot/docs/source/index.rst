Welcome to ChoiRbot!
=======================================

**ChoiRbot** is a ROS 2 package developed by `Andrea Testa <https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/a.testa/en>`_,
`Andrea Camisa <https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/a.camisa/en>`_ and
`Giuseppe Notarsefano <https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/giuseppe.notarstefano/en>`_  within the ERC excellence
research project `OPT4SMART <http://opt4smart.dei.unibo.it>`_.
The aim of **ChoiRbot** is to provide a comprehensive framework to easily simulate and run
experiments on teams of cooperating robots, with a particular focus on peer-to-peer networks
of robotic agents without a central coordinator.

The package is already equipped with basic trajectory planning, control and dynamics integration utilities,
so that you can already start to test your distributed algorithms on basic robot models such as quadrotors,
unicycle-like vehicles and single-integrator dynamical systems.
Please refer to :ref:`api_documentation` for a detailed description of the package functionalities.
