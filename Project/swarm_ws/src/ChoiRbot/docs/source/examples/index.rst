Examples
***********************
Here we report some examples that show how to implement distributed control
schemes using **ChoiRbot**.


Introductory examples
========================
The following examples are intended to introduce the reader to the features
of **ChoiRbot**. We suggest reading through these examples in order, as
their description becomes less and less fine-grained and more difficult
to understand due to the increasing complexity of the scenario.
